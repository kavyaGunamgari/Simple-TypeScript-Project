# quick-table
A simple TypeScript-based web application that allows users‚Äîespecially kids‚Äîto quickly view multiplication tables by entering any number. This project was created as a beginner-friendly learning exercise while exploring TypeScript.

üß† Problem Statement :

While learning TypeScript, I wanted to build a small but meaningful project to get hands-on experience. I realized that many kids waste time searching for multiplication tables on the internet. To solve this, I built a simple, fast-loading website where a child can just enter a number, click a button, and instantly see the full multiplication table‚Äîwithout ads or distractions.

This project is a small attempt to reduce search time and help kids learn tables more efficiently.
